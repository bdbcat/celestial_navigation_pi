<h1><u>Celestial Navigation Plugin for OpenCPN</u></h1>
<hr>

<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>The plugin facilitates finding the position of boats using Celestial
Navigation (no GPS), and a Marine Sextant. It expands on the concept
of Line of Position (LOP) by incorporating measurement error and
displays true positions, typically as circles (COP). Notably, it
allows sights based on bearing as well as altitude.

<h2>Sights Dialog</h2>

<p>When the plugin is opened the first dialog shows your sights which have been
entered.  Select <i>New</i> to enter a new sight. <i>Duplicate</i> an existing
sight. <i>Edit</i> to view and make changes to an existing sight. <i>Delete</i>
a sight or <i>Delete All sights</i>. To show a sight’s Circle of Position (COP)
 on the charts, select/unselect the “E<i>ye</i>” icon. There is no limit to the
number of sights.  But the more sights, the slower it takes to open the plugin. 

<h3>Sight Tab</h3>

Sight Measurement (Hs) is an angular measurement of an astronomical body using a
sextant. It can be one of these types: 

<ul>
<li>Altitude: Angle of the body above the horizon (most common method)</li>
<li>Azimuth: angle to north; non-standard due to measurement difficulty use the
angle to north.  Azimuth sights are not regularly taken, because it
is difficult to measure more accurately than 1 degree which normally
results in errors above 100 nautical miles. </li>
<li>Lunar: angle from the moon to another body for clock correction</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Celestial Body</b>: You can select the Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Mercury, and 57 Navigation Stars plus Polaris that are visible in either
the Northern or Southern Hemisphere

<p> <b>Limb</b>: For altitude or lunar shots of the Sun and Moon, choose lower
limb unless obscured; then use upper limb. For lunar sights with the sun,
select upper for outer limbs, lower for inner limbs, center if both are upper
or lower. 

<p><b>Sight Measurement (Hs)</b>: Enter your sextant reading. Integer degrees
in the degrees field, and decimal minutes in the minutes field. Your sextant can
only measure 0.1 minutes of arc. 

<p><b>Minutes of uncertainty</b> determine the width of the plotted circle or
line of position COP/LOP. Too small and it won’t be easily seen on the chart.
0.1 Minutes of uncertainty is visible, zooming into a chart scale 1:600,000.
10 or larger is visible when zooming out into a chart scale 1:50,000,000.

<p><b>FIND</b>. When you press this button, the sight you input is reduced
using the Law of Cosines. Law of Cosines is used to compute Altitude (Hc), the
altitude you would have measured with your sextant if you were truly at your
DR position.  It also calculates Azimuth (Zn) which is the Bearing to the body
from your DR position.  Intercept is the distance in nautical miles your DR is
towards or away from the body.  Azimuth (Zn) defaults to True North. Magnetic
can be selected.  The DR position defaults to Your Boat’s Latitude and
Longitude. You can change that location to the DR position when you take your
sight. The Lat/Lon is in decimal degrees where North is positive, South is
negative, the East is positive and West is negative.  

<h3>Time (UTC) Tab</h3>

Must be the exact moment of your sight measurement at UTC. Know the time zone
where you are taking your sights.

<p><b>Date</b>defaults to the system clock when a new sight is selected.
Date needs to be the UTC date, not the local or system clock time. A twilight
sight is taken at 20:25:35 April 22 at UTC-4, also known as ZD+4.
The UTC is 00:25:35 April 23.  The next day!

<p><b>Time (Hours, Minutes, Seconds)</b> defaults to the system clock when a
new sight is selected. Time needs to be UTC, not local or system clock time.
A digital watch or quartz watch with UTC and local time is best. Be sure to
manually adjust Time to correspond with the exact UTC moment the sight was
taken, see Watch Error below. 

<p><b>Recording</b>: In preparation, set the stopwatch and record UTC time.
When the sight is taken, say “Mark”, so the assistant can record stopwatch
time and the sight body and altitude, or if you are solo, try using a recording
timer app on your cell phone with a wired microphone.

<p><b>Time Certainty</b> default is 0 seconds which shows a signal darker line
in the COP. A time Certainty of &gt; 0 shows two darker lines, equivalent to
that many seconds apart. 

<h3>DR Shift Tab</h3>

If one of your sights was taken earlier and your position changed for a
subsequent sight, do not change the date and time values. Use the DR Shift Tab
for your earlier sight. Enter DR Distance traveled and DR Track (Bearing) you
made for the later sight.  You’ll see the earlier COP shifted or advanced.
Shifted sights are not used by the <b>Fix Button.</b>  You can determine your
Fix visually on your chart.  Drop and label a Mark to represent your Fix, a
Running Fix.

<h3>Clock Offset Tab</h3>

Clock Offset or Correction adjusts and redraws all stored sights (shown or
not). It can be used to set DeltaT, although the plugin calculates celestial
objects value using current DeltaT formulas. Many traditional navigators prefer
to leave Clock Offset to &quot;0&quot; because they included compensating for
watch error in individual sights when entering UTC. Sean suggests adjusting
the global &quot;Clock Offset&quot; until COP converge to determine local
clock accuracy. No matter how Watch Error is adjusted, do it consistently to
ensure precise navigational calculations based on celestial observations. 

<h3>Config Tab</h3>

Changing color and transparency appearance does not affect the results. 

<h3>Parameters Tab</h3>

This is where Index Error, Height of Eye, Temp/Pressure of the sight is
entered.  Generally, the same values for the sights at a given date and time. 
Change settings to change the default for new sights, settings will be
 remembered for the next new sight. 

<h3>Calculations Tab</h3>

Shows altitude sight calculations for user verification and program
collaboration. 

<h2>Fix Button (computing a fix)</h2>

<p>The fix is determined from the sights with COPs made visible. Need two or
more sights with COPs shown.  Initially, the algorithm seeks a Fix nearest
Your Boat.  If it doesn’t find it, enter the closest dead reckoning latitude
and longitude, and try again.  When a Fix is found, a large red X is displayed
on the chart. When the Fix button is closed, the X disappears from the chart.

<p>The Fix algorithm uses the least squares regression to find a position at
sea level for altitude type of sights.  It is not implemented for shifted
sights, sights taken above sea level altitudes, and true north azimuth type
of sights.

<h2>Hide/Show Button</h2>

<p>Hide makes the Celestial Navigation Sights form smaller. You can use your
pointer to expand or contract the form’s size.  You can move the Celestial
Navigation Sights form out of the way.

<h2>Common Problems</h2>

<p>Circle of Position or sight is not appearing. If you do not see a COP on
the chart, ensure the visible (eye) icon appears in the Sight List, then zoom
out and pan the earth to find it. If you are looking for a COP of a body, use
a Star Finder to determine Altitude at your desired time and location or try
Hs of 75 degrees. Hs of 90 degrees is almost a point and is the Latitude and
Longitude of the GP of the body. <b>Calculations tab </b>will give the Body’s
Latitude, Longitude and Ho Altitude. 

<p>If the <b>Find button</b>’s Altitude (Hc) and Azimuth (Zn) is way off from
what you expected. The default Hc and Zn is calculated using your Boat
position. Did you Move your boat to the DR location of the sight? Is your DR
mark correctly shown on your OpenCPN chart?

<h2>Reduce Errors:</h2>

<p><b>Adjustable errors</b>. Prior to sight taking, adjust your sextant to
 remove errors.  

<p><b>Index Error.</b> Reverify your index error using the horizon. IE is part
of your sight measurement.

<p><b>Height of Eye.</b> Measure your height of eye above sea-level.
This is part of your sight measurements. Natural Horizon sights are supported.
Dip Short is not yet supported.

<p><b>Run of Sights</b>: For each body, take a run of 3 to 6 sights, a minute
or so between sights. Input the entire run into the Celestial Navigation Sights
form. Look at the Circle of Positions for these sights. Throw out the sights
that look like errors. If they all look good, consider calculating an average
sight and use that for your Estimated Position, Running Fix, or Fix.

<p><b>Multi-Body Sights</b>: To get the best possible location, try to take a
3-body sight within 20-minute timeframe. The Sun, Moon, and Venus sometimes
make a good 3 body during the day. Ensure the celestial bodies are adequately
spaced apart. Two bodies should be 45 to 135 degrees apart. For three bodies,
the 3rd outer bodies should be over 30 and less than 120 degrees from the other
two bodies. Input the sights into the Celestial Navigation Sights form and make
visible the best of each body’s COP. The three body COPs will make a triangle.
The fix would be in the center of the triangle. If your vessel was in motion,
use DR Shift tab to advance the Line of Position (LOP) of the first and second
sights to the third sight. When the sights are taken within 20 minutes, it is
considered a fix. Otherwise, a running fix.

<p><b>Running Fix: </b> If the bodies were taken hours apart and are 45 to 135
degrees apart, it could be considered a Running Fix, the next best thing to a
Fix. The quality of the running fix is dependent on maintaining a careful DR
plot.  The morning Sun and afternoon Sun make a good Running Fix. Evaluate set
and drift (current) to determine your DR track.  Use the DR Shift tab.

<p><b>Correct Time</b>: Celestial navigation uses the positions of stars, the
sun, and the moon relative to the observer's position on Earth. Because the
Earth rotates, these positions change every moment.  Navigators use the precise
time of observation synchronized to UTC to calculate their location.  

<p><b>Watch Error</b>: Monitor the quartz watch against Marine Radio
frequencies to determine its accuracy for the day. The navigator records and
tracks their watch's error trend to estimate the day’s watch error.  

<p><b>Practice</b>: The more sights you take and input into Celestial
Navigation Plugin, the more accurate your sights will become. Many beginners
start off with 5 nm accuracy and improve to 3 nm accuracy. Experts are accurate
to within 1 nm.  

<p><b>Personal Bias Error</b>: To determine their average personal bias error,
some navigators track their sight history (hundreds of sights) to determine
average personal bias error. An ex-US Navy colleague continuously practices,
knows his average error, and adjusts his sights accordingly. 

<h2>Navigation in principle</h2>

<p>Of course, if you already know where you are, there is no point in trying
to determine it from the formulas above. But when you actually navigate, the
odds are you don't know quite where you are, so how do we use the above
formulas? 

<p>We draw what is called a position line or Sumner line. Although the modern
position line is not quite a real Sumner line, but it is close enough. 

<p>Like all good inventions, Sumner lines were discovered by chance by a fellow
called, you guessed right, &quot;Sumner&quot;, Thomas H. Sumner to be precise
(maybe related to the late professor Julius Sumner-Miller). Sumner was a ship
captain on his way from Charleston (South Carolina) to Greenock (Scotland). And
he was worried because he had been sailing for several days in bad weather, the
wind was blowing from the Southeast making Ireland a lee shore, and he had not
been able to see the sun or any stars, the coast was getting near, and he did
not know exactly where he was. Suddenly there was a break in the clouds, so he
grabbed his sextant and snatched a quick sun sight, before the clouds covered
the sky again. 

<p>Now he was wondering what to do with this information, so he played a
&quot;what if&quot; game. He did not use the bearing formula above, because
nobody had worked it out in quite that form yet, but he knew the altitude
formula and he said, &quot;what if my latitude is... &quot; and calculated the
corresponding longitude and he plotted it on the chart, then he tried it again
with another latitude, got another point on the chart. After doing that three
or four times he suddenly realized that all the points he was marking on the
chart seemed to fall on a straight line. Without thinking about it anymore, he
saw that the line needed pushing north by a few odd miles to lead straight over
Small's light, so he turned north for those few miles, then turned to starboard
until he was sailing parallel to that very first &quot;Sumner line&quot;. His
crew were a bit perplexed at that, wondering if the captain had gone mad, but
when suddenly they arrived right at the very light, they thought he was a
flaming genius. And so did the rest of the sailing community. 

<p>So why did the points fall on a straight line? They did not really but
Sumner did not realize it at the time. The points Sumner was plotting were the
points on earth from which anyone would have seen, at the same moment as he
did, the sun with exactly the same altitude. All those points are on a circle
centered at the point on earth directly below the sun. Because this circle is
usually huge, a small part of it appears straight on a Mercator projection
chart. 

<p>So this is how we proceed in practice: 

<ol>
<li>We assume we know where we are, we call this DR (for Dead Reckoning).</li>
<li>We calculate, based on the latitude and longitude of the DR, what the
bearing and the altitude of the celestial object would be at the time of
observation.</li>
<li>We draw the bearing line passing through DR.</li>
<li>We compare the actual measured altitude with what it would have been
had we been at DR, the difference, in minutes of arc, is equal to the number of
nautical miles that we have to move along the bearing line to find our position
line. ie if the angle measured is greater than the calculated one by say 13' of
arc, then we move towards the celestial object by 13 nautical miles, and if say
the measured angle was less by 7' of arc than the calculated one, we would move
away from the celestial object by 7 nautical miles.</li>
<li>Finally, draw a line at the right angle to the bearing line, passing by the
point we have just found. This line is our position line and all we can tell is
we are somewhere on this line.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note the difference between our position line and Sumner's original one: our
line is the tangent to the circle at the point nearest to DR, Sumner's was the
circle. Sumner's line is in theory more accurate, but the circle is usually so
large that the loss of accuracy is insignificant. Note also that in the tropics
the circles can be extremely small, I remember reading about a P&amp;O captain
who used to obtain all his fixes without any calculation, he would take several
observations when the sun was nearly dead overhead (say over a 15 minute
period) for each time observation, he would plot the coordinates (GHA,DEC) of
the Sun on his map then draw a circle of radius equal to (90 degrees - measured
altitude). Since over the 15-minute period he would probably have collected 4
or 5 observations, he would draw 4 or 5 circles which would all intersect at
one point. Simple but effective, especially as in the tropics, position lines
usually end up running almost North-South giving good longitude information but
lousy intercepts and large errors in latitude. The noon sight is damn important
 then.

<p>If you wait a few hours, the sun will change position, and you will be able
to repeat the operation and determine a 2nd position line which will intersect
the first. Provided you haven't moved in the interval, you are at the
intersection. 

<p>If you have moved (and the odds, are you would because it can be pretty
boring sitting around doing nothing on a boat that's just bobbing up and down
in the middle of the ocean), then all you need do is translate the original
position line in the same direction, and the same distance as you have
travelled. Your position will be at the intercept of the new line and the
translated one. Sailors call this the SUN RUN SUN method.

<h2>Accuracy Testing Procedures</h2>

<ol>
<li>Periodic report of Celestial Navigation Plugin accuracy and precision
against the Commercial Edition of the Nautical Almanac. To be done during
upgrades or as part of an annual or every other year review.</li>
<li>Calculation (NA versus Plugin) using 3 statistics (see below)</li>
<li>Results are summarized on the Celestial Navigation Plugin webpage. </li>
<li>Users will know the accuracy and precision to expect from the plugin.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Established Accuracy Goal</h2>

<ol>
<li>Mean and Standard Deviation of the Differences. Our target standard
deviation is 0.1 nm or 0.1 minutes.</li>
<li>Percent of observations with 0 difference. Nautical Almanac data is no
finer than 0.1 minutes. Celestial Navigation data will normalize to the
same precision for purpose of apples-to-apples comparison. </li>
<li>Percent of observations greater than 0.1 minute or less than 0.1 minutes.
Due to rounding at .1, these observation differences would be .2 minutes or
larger.</li>
<li>0.1 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.1 nautical miles is 600 feet, 185
meters</li>
